# Germany Population map 2022 with D3.js

Just a simple visualization for the population living in Germany at the end of 2022.

In order to run it locally, just clone it and host it with a tool of choice.
For quick projects like this, I just use Python with this command
"python3 -m http.server"

And it will be hosted in localhost:8000
