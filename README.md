# Germany Population Map with D3.js

A simple visualization for the population living in Germany at the end of 2022.

In order to run it locally, just clone it and host it with a tool of choice. <br>
For quick projects like this, I just host the local files with Python with this command
`python3 -m http.server`

And it will be hosted in `localhost:8000`
